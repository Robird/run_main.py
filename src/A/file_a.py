# src/A/file_a.py
# This is a simple helper module, primarily used for import by other example modules.
# It does not define a _main() function and is therefore not intended to be run directly with run_main.py.
# VAL_A is intentionally set to a recognizable string to confirm successful import in other modules.
# (中文注解: 一个简单的辅助模块，用于被其他示例导入。)
VAL_A = "Value from file_a in package A"
